Qualcomm RPM Powerdomains

* For RPM powerdomains, we communicate a performance state to RPM
which then translates it into a corresponding voltage on a rail

Required Properties:
 - compatible: Should be one of the following
	* qcom,rpmpd-msm8996: RPM Powerdomain for the msm8996 family of SoC
 - power-domain-cells: number of cells in power domain specifier
	must be 1.
 - domain-performance-state: One or more nodes describing the performance-states
	supported by the powerdomain.
	For domain-performance-state bindings refer to
	Documentation/devicetree/bindings/power/power_domain.txt
